      <div class="description">
        <p>I am a curious and creative person by nature, and I am always looking to develop new skills. I found software development an interesting area and I have been focusing myself in web technologies such as AngularJS and Bootstrap and enjoying building things with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>My learning path as taken me through code academy, where I learnt about JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS. And then to re-enforce my knowledge in a more structured way I started to actively focus on a full stack javascript and front end web certified specialisation within Coursera, thought by the University of Hong Kong of Science and Technology. In these courses is where I have learnt the most significant technologies such as bower, angular, gulp, node, and others. I am now starting to play around with Ionic for mobile development, and I pretend to dive deeper into the node.js realm.

        <img src="img/matchgame.png" class="projects-img">
        <p>In my first simple project I practice the skills I just learned in the HTML, CSS and javaScript course. I managed to style a game interface applying css classes and build the game logic and interactivity with javaScript. So the player could keep leveling up by clicking on the extra smile.</p>
